# Cognitive Test UI

Asalam Aliukum everyone👋🏻. I am Basmala Sabra. This is a **static UI design** for a cognitive test results page. The design presents a user's score based on different cognitive abilities, including **Reaction Time, Memory, Verbal Skills, and Visual Processing**. The layout is clean, modern, and visually appealing.

## 🎨 Features

- A **results card** displaying the overall score.
- A **summary section** showing scores for different cognitive abilities.
- A **"continue" button** (currently non-functional).
- **Gradient and minimalistic design** for a professional look.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a dark mode toggle.

- Enhance responsiveness for better mobile compatibility.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** & **CSS** for the structure and styling.
